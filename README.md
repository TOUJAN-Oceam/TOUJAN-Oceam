# Hi there, I'm Océam TOUJAN! 👋

 **Engineering Student @ CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay)**

Specializing in Healthcare & Biomedical Services for my last years, i am learning about **Engineering**, **Data Science**, and **Healthcare**. I have been working on various project combining IA (ML and DL) and healthcare.

I have fell in love with data analysis and prediction, that is why 

**I am looking for a thesis in either the field of sports + data or health + data**.

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 🧠 [Epilepsy Detection & Monitoring (Hackathon 2026)](https://github.com/TOUJAN-Oceam/Hackathon_paris_saclay_2026)
*Paris-Saclay University Hackathon Project*
- **Goal:** Develop and monitor non-invasive methods to demonstrate drug efficacy/treatment response in rare pediatric developmental epilepsies.
- **Ideas:** Streamline communication between parents, doctors, and data scientists for pediatric epilepsy.
- **Tech:** Python Flask (Interface), Random Forest (Seizure Detection), Eye-tracking to create worldfirst dataset.
- **Impact:** Designed a prototype to correlate eye movements with rare developmental epilepsy seizures.

### 💤 [Sleep Stage Classification (Kaggle Challenge)](https://github.com/TOUJAN-Oceam/Kaggle_ML_3A_CentraleSupelec)
*Beacon Biosignals Sleep Staging Challenge 2025*
- **Goal:** Predict sleep stages (Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) from EEG signals.
- **Tech:** sleep biomarkers and keys features, XGBoost and RandomForester, Spectral Analysis (Welch, Spectrograms), Optuna (Hyperparameter tuning).
- **Result:** Almost 0.8 F1 Score (Accuracy vs Recall) performance with a robust Cross-Validation (LOSO) XGboost strategy.

### 🤖 [Deep learning kaggle competition (and soon final project)](https://github.com/TOUJAN-Oceam/Kaggle_DL_3A_CentraleSupelec)
*Gymnastic and shooting drill challenge 2026* and soon *Bioanalysis project*
- **Goal:** Predict pass/fail gymnastic exam, and predict number of crossbar hit in 20 minutes by players.
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gymnastic-exam and https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/10-minute-shooting-drill.
